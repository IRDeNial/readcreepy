Lucky for you that&#39;s all pretty much out of the way. I can&#39;t get the disc to run in any other Wii, which ultimately means I have no evidence apart from the physical disc itself, which is pretty useless really. What I want to find out is who that man is. That slender character who&#39;s been in my dreams, and behind my shoulder for the last 8 months. Is he actually coming for me? I don&#39;t know where to begin. How can I find out anything about the silhouette of a slender male, who&#39;s body (since the disk is dead) I will never be able to focus on properly. It seemed the only way would be to ask about my old friend&#39;s death, but it just doesn&#39;t seem right. I barely know him anymore, and I can&#39;t bring myself to intervene. That being said I am going on a mini holiday back to my old city tomorrow, with Joe. Then would probably be a better time than any. Tell me what you guys think. I still need all the help I can get on this. </p>\n\n<p>But I don&#39;t bloody know anymore. I&#39;ve got my exams in a few weeks and before I know it it&#39;ll be the real deal. I really don&#39;t need this crap in my life right now. Stress from exams plus stress from the fact that someone is out to fucking kill me is sort of not a great recipe, you know? I feel like I&#39;m going to keel over and die before the figure gets to me. And who knows, maybe that&#39;s what he wants. Maybe he&#39;s never physically killed anyone. Maybe my old friend saw the webcam feed as well, and died of a heart attack. Or maybe not. I&#39;m being rediclious now, sorry. I&#39;ll update you again, either during my trip back to my old home city (which is Bath, if you must know), or after it. The outcome of the trip will probably end up being that I make the journey to my old friend&#39;s house and then walk away last minute. I&#39;ve always been like that. Maybe I should actually arrange to sit down with his family and talk. It&#39;s been about 5 months since his death. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s to soon or not, I&#39;ve never experienced anything similar.</p>\n\n<p>Apologies for not being able to get Joe to talk about any of this. He tries to brush it off but you can see that it gets to him. Also sorry if you were expecting more of this blog. I know it doesn&#39;t really have any extra information but sharing the problem with you all and getting everything of my chest is making me feel a little better. </p>\n\n<p>Okey-dokey. It&#39;s been about a month since Bath, apologies for the lack of update. Time to tell you what went down. </p>\n\n<p>In the end we did go to my old friend&#39;s house. I&#39;ll admit it felt weird turning up there after so long, and with someone else they&#39;d never even met, but we needed information. We knocked on the door. His mum answered, and it seemed that she recognised me instantly. &quot;Hi Anna, it&#39;s been ages&quot; I said.\n&quot;It certainly has. I thought you moved away, what brings you back to Bath?&quot;\nI had to be honest.\n&quot;I heard about Jackson, and well, I was wondering how he died, if that&#39;s alright...&quot;\n&quot;Suicide&quot;\nAnd then she slammed the door shut, almost immediately.</p>\n\n<p>This raises a lot of questions, perhaps tying in with the idea that he doesn&#39;t physically kill you, its the paranoia that gets you. This also makes me think that he must have seen the webcam feed. Perhaps even the one of Joe and I. But now if we think we know this figure&#39;s tactics, we can play him. All we need to keep is our friends, and our sanity.</p>\n\n<p>I also went to visit a few friends from the primary school me and Jackson both went to. Nobody seemed to know a thing about it. I mean, they knew it happened, but no details. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s funny. When you&#39;re this frightened for what&#39;s going to happen next you&#39;re focused exclusively on one thing. You never really look around you. There was a nice moment when me and Joe visited Bath, about a minute when the whole thing left my mind. Joe and I were sat in the caf√©, and I looked out the window. It&#39;s beautiful when you see the busy world go by whilst in a warm, safe building. Makes you think that even if the worst should happen to us, the world will keep turning. If only that moment could&#39;ve lasted just a little longer. But as soon as my eyes peeled away from that rain-spattered window, the clouds in my mind gathered back.</p>\n\n<p>For those of you who are probably asking yourselves why we haven&#39;t gone to the police, it&#39;s because there is nothing to show. A half broken video game disc just isn&#39;t going to cut it. That being said, Joe brought up that there must be some sort of information about that shop &quot;John&#39;s Games&quot;. There must be a license, or a picture or something. Oh and another thing. Before we went to Bath we had a look through street view to remind me of it. When you go to Park Street Mews and set the in-software clock back to 2008, there is a shop there. Well, a stool in somebody&#39;s garage. There is a peice of paper on the counter that say &quot;John&#39;s Games and DVDs&quot;. And on the stool, there are 3 discs. One of them looks oddly familiar. Behind the stool, a thin shadow stands.</p>\n\n<p>The next time I do an update, well, who knows what we will have found out. Perhaps we will even have closure by then. It still seems unlikely though. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s enough. Until next time people.</p>\n\n<p>Arthur</p>\n</div>\n","author":"ProperMrDachshund99"}
