As our bus took a turn,We came to the entrance of the colony.I caught a glimpse of the Board.CAUSALITY,It read.&quot;Thats one strange name for a colony,CAUSALITY&quot;Replied <a href=\"https://Jermy.As\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jermy.As</a> we moved away from the colony,We saw a long tunnel starting from the back gate of the colony which went on till the horizon.&quot;What a long tunnel&quot; Exclaimed Jermy.After two hours of travel,we reached his place.&quot;Welcome,Guys........Come on in.....This is my house...&quot;He welcomed us.His house was completely plain......With very little furniture,enough for three to four people.&quot;So,what are we gonna do?&quot; I asked Rick.&quot;Lets go and check out the CAUSALITY colony....&quot; said Jermy.&quot;Wait......what!!!&quot; exclaimed Rick.His face become pale......But he quickly recovered.I was okay with the plan.We got on a bus and went to a place which Rick claimed as the half way point between his old house and his new one.We Got <a href=\"https://down.As\" rel=\"nofollow\">down.As</a> i moved a few steps away from the bus stop,I realised that something was wrong,I quickly came to my senses.</p>\n\n<p>There was only two of us,Me and <a href=\"https://Jermy.My\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jermy.My</a> Phone <a href=\"https://rang.It\" rel=\"nofollow\">rang.It</a> was Rick.&quot;Come on guys,You left me and got down did you?,Any way,Pick up a car from there  and follow the road down.....&quot;He hung <a href=\"https://up.As\" rel=\"nofollow\">up.As</a> he mentioned,There was a car rental nearby,It was an old rusted building with a dozen cars.The owner was an old man in is Late 60s.&quot;Welcome,Sirs&quot;He said in a shallow crooked voice.......&quot;We need a car,For about 4 to 5 hours.&quot; said Jermy.&quot;Ofcourse sir,But currently we have only two doors......Hope its okay for you guys...Two people can sit comfortably.....&quot;Said the owner.</p>\n\n<p>I did&#39;nt know why,but his voice and that place spooked me.....As Dusk came closer,We picked up a car and rode off to the CAUSALITY colony.Rick was waiting for us at the front gate.......We joined him and moved inside.The Gate was locked.Jermy did not hesitate to break the lock,as it was old and rusted.We proceeded inside.We were surrounded by Houses and Shops and most importantly Vehicles.Vehicles here and there.......Parked in an Untidy manner.&quot;Woah, thats a lot of vehicles for a single street.&quot; I thought.&quot;Yes, no one wanted to come back to this place,even to collect thier belongings.&quot;Said Rick For some reason,I felt uneasy with his answer,Really uneasy......We traveled deep into the colony,It was very large.Soon,we ended up at Rick&#39;s old house.Rick started to shiver.&quot;Whats wrong Rick?&quot;,Asked Jermy.&quot;Nothing,Natures call.....&quot;said Rick and Immediately moved away from us to a public restroom at the corner of the street.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;He could have thought about it.......His house would have a restroom right?&quot; said Jermy.........He asked me my phone as his phone did not have a camera.I gave him mine.Then suddenly a grieve thought dawned upon me........The word &#39;thought&#39; started to haunt me.........I realised what was going through my mind.........Earlier,Rick just replied to my thought!!!!! I got goosebumps all over my body.But before i could hold on and take a breath,Jermy was already inside the house.I followed <a href=\"https://him.One\" rel=\"nofollow\">him.One</a> of the most tidiest house i could have ever seen.The place was so clean,neat and tidy.The walls were decorated beautifully, the paintjob and furnitures looked stunning.Then I realised that Jermy was no more with me.........&quot;Hey,John,Come over here.........&quot; a voice came from upstairs......It was Jermy......I went upstairs and found..........nobody.........Not even a single soul was there.</p>\n\n<p>There was a loud bang downstairs.I went down and found that the main door was sealed.......Tight.Shivers went down my spine.....I started walking around the house ,observing everything around me.The house had no windows.Yes,zero windows.i was alone.Both Rick and Jermy were gone,Then suddenly a thought crossed my mind.&quot;Are those two playing some kind of cheap trick with me&quot; But i could&#39;nt accept the fact.I went into one of the bedrooms ,I could&#39;nt dare to close the door.I switched on the lights.The room was empty,with only a single bed and a bedside table.The place was so cold.I looked around.......Nothing.Suddenly i heard a loud sound from above........It was an attic door,Who places an attic door in the middle of a bedroom i thought to myself.......Inevitably, I found myself up the attic.</p>\n\n<p>To my horror,the attic was filled with.........blood.......I could hear my heartbeat.........I started breathing heavily.....The place was lit by a small bulb,and in the middle of the attic there was a stuffed bear,which HELD a mirror,Yes,It HELD a mirror, a hand mirror.The Bear was staring right into my face......It was as if the Bear told me.......Go away.......My phone rang.I picked it <a href=\"https://up.It\" rel=\"nofollow\">up.It</a> was from Rick.I answered the call.The word Hello did not come out from my mouth.&quot;Go to Sleep&quot; A terrifying voice said.I dropped my phone and and ran down.The bedroom door was slammed shut.I was sure,I left it open.......I could not take it.......If it was a prank,I had enough of it..........I went towards the attic to call any one of them..........I suddenly <a href=\"https://stopped.My\" rel=\"nofollow\">stopped.My</a> legs started to shiver.........My phone.......How did it end up in my pocket........I am sure i gave it to Jer...Jermy.</p>\n\n<p>I was terrified.........I hear the sound of the rain........It was a downpour,A really heavy one.I looked around.......I saw a bathroom door attached to the bedroom,I was pretty sure that it did not exist earlier,But i did not want to question myself.I went for a <a href=\"https://pee.As\" rel=\"nofollow\">pee.As</a> i went to the wash basin to wash my face.The mirror was filled with <a href=\"https://fog.To\" rel=\"nofollow\">fog.To</a> my horror,words started appearing on the glass.&quot;Go to sleep&quot; it read.......&quot;Go to sleep&quot; a sweet voice came from the bedroom.I heard a cracking sound. </p>\n\n<p>I turned towards the mirror,the mirror started to crack,and blood seeped out of the cracks.I jumped out of my skin........Next second.I found myself laying on the bed,cloaking myself with the thickest bedsheet i got from there.I heard the bedroom door open.I neither closed it,nor opened it.I took a peak.......At the door,The stuffed bear from the attic was sitting.Only this time,Its hand mirror was cracked,its fur was soaked in blood.I threw the bedsheet away and ran downstairs.The Main door was sealed tight.I started hearing a sound........A second later, I Realized it was the clock,It was 7:68 PM,It was a digital clock,It showed 68th Minute and Tic Tokked,.........The Tic-Toc Sound seemed like a ghastly moan to me.......I took a look at <a href=\"https://watch.It\" rel=\"nofollow\">watch.It</a> was 8:08PM.It put my hands down my pocket and reached out for my phone.</p>\n\n<p>Yes,My phone was again in my <a href=\"https://pocket.My\" rel=\"nofollow\">pocket.My</a> phone too,showed the time as 7:68PM.I turned around.I looked around trying to find an exit.I found an open door,It led to the basement.Icould not move myself into the basement.I suddenly heard a sound.This time it was a familiar sound for me.A sound made by a microwave oven.I went into the kitchen.The Kitchen was probably the coldest part of the house.The refridgerator&#39;s door was wide open.I took a peek into the Fridge.........A human Skeleton.......I had enough of it......I wanted to run,But was stopped by the oven&#39;s sound,Yet again...........I closed one part of view with my hand,hoping that i need not look at the fridge.Inside the oven,What i saw,Just turned my stomach,Inside out.........It was a human hand,Baked.I saw myself into a mirror by the oven...........</p>\n\n<p>The mirror was cracked,and <a href=\"https://bleeding.It\" rel=\"nofollow\">bleeding.It</a> was as if the back of my head in the reflection was bleeding.I could not stand it.......I immediately ran out of the kitchen........As i exited the kitchen.....I realised that something was wrong with the kitchen mirror.........I looked straight into the mirror,But i saw the back of my head in the reflection.I felt like being watched.I could not take it anymore,If the only way out was the Basement,Let it be.......As i proceeded towards the basement door,I saw a horrific sight.The basement door was closed,and the bear was sitting on top of the door..........&quot;You are late&quot; a voice came from the bear.I gathered the little courage i had........and dashed towards the basement door............Before i knew it, I was outside.I did not know what happened,I was at the back of the house.</p>\n\n<p>The rain was pouring down.I saw a silhouette down the street.Both of them ran towards me.Rick and Jermy.Before i could ask any questions.&quot;Lets get outta here&quot; said Jermy.I did not want to ask them any questions........Cuz i already knew what could have happened.We went out through the back gate and found us at the entrance of the tunnel.I did not know how my car ended up here,but i already saw worse.......Rick hurriedly opened the back door,breaking the handle.......We smashed the glass and all three of us were inside the car.We drove away,Into the tunnel..........CASUALITY I read, as we drove away.As we were midway through the tunnel,Rick screamed.............Louder than any other i have heard.......I stopped the car........We turned back asked,&quot;Whats wrong.....&quot;He remained silent...........</p>\n\n<p>The entire surrounding was silent.............As the raindrops bounced of the bonnet,the splashing of the raindrops reminded me that we were late.We exited the tunel and somehow made it to the Car rental........It was the dawn of the next day,But the rental was open.The Owner came out.&quot;Sorry for the delay,we shall pay the extra charge for the extra time,and the handle of the backdoor is broken,We will pay for that too.....&quot; I said.&quot;No,child there is no extra charge........And what backdoor......&quot;I was horrified,We booked a two door car........I looked back........Rick was gone and so was the seat........Jermy was shivering.&quot;whats wrong?&quot; I asked as if nothing happened........&quot;Did you hear it....?&quot; He asked,Shivering......&quot;what?,Hear What?&quot;I asked.&quot;Back in the tunnel,Did you hear it....?&quot;&quot;What,I did not hear anything other than the splashes made by the rain drops on the bonnet and the shiverings of our lost friend.......&quot;I replied.&quot;So you heard it...........We were INSIDE a Tunnel and you heard the rain drops splashing on the bonnet.........And now, a guy who came with us is lost.......&quot;His words spooked me out of my skin.......After that, i was bedridden for a week and could not contact any of the two................I don&#39;t want to know more about the place or the incident anyways.... </p>\n</div>\n","author":"TheShadowProtagonist"}
