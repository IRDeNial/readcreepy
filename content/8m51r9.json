And it will. And I don&#39;t know what is going on yet, but I will find out and I&#39;ll keep you guys posted. I can&#39;t write it as soon as it happens - I can feel that they are watching me. But you need to know just in case. I&#39;m fully aware that they are capable of killing me. </p>\n\n<p><em>.</em>.<em>.</em></p>\n\n<p>No one noticed what happened. It was in broad daylight, but they were fast. I just so happened to see the car get a flat while I was walking out of the park. It wasn&#39;t weird at all to see that family get a flat but watching a man in his thirties walk up to the dad and stab his neck with a needle made me stay in the park. </p>\n\n<p>I hid behind a tree and then moved towards some bushes so that I could get a better view. The dad was drugged I think. Or poisoned. I couldn&#39;t really tell. The mom came out to check on him, and the killer&#39;s wife? slit her throat from one end to the other. There were two kids in the car, one was like 5 and the other was probably 14. She killed them mercilessly. She didn&#39;t even look phased by the fact that they were kids.</p>\n\n<p>They packed the bodies neatly in their car and drove off. I didn&#39;t know what to do guys. I watched this happen and they seemed trained. At some point, I heard them speaking Russian. I&#39;m scared. I don&#39;t think they saw me, but I literally just saw an entire family get murdered. I was so scared. </p>\n\n<p>I ran home. But then, right across the street from my house, I found the car again. Just sitting in front of the house that was marked sold just last week. I remember being filled with dread then.</p>\n\n<p>The killer&#39;s wife walked out, now wearing a sundress and a friendly smile on her face. That was the moment that I made a choice. </p>\n\n<p>[I have a schizophrenia, so I know no one will believe me 😞 even though I&#39;ve been taking my meds on time and every day- scout&#39;s honor.]</p>\n\n<p>I walked up to the house, smiled and greeted her. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Welcome to Ocean City, I&#39;m Jay. where are you guys coming from?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m Martha. My family and I just moved from Texas. My husband actually got a promotion in his job. We are so excited. You look as though you&#39;re almost my William&#39;s age – maybe you two should hang out!”</p>\n\n<p>It was weird talking to her now. She didn&#39;t have the slightest accent now. She had one earlier. I remember being super freaked that the Russian spies were killing an entire family. </p>\n\n<p>Just as I was contemplating that, a boy just about the age the other walked out of the house...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hey I&#39;m Willy&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The timing was too perfect. It Made me all the more suspicious, but that could be because I just saw this woman kill two kids and their mom.\n”Hey Willy – I’m Jay. Just came over to welcome you guys to the neighborhood.”\n”awesome. Well, we are still working on unpacking. Maybe when we are finished we can hang out”</p>\n\n<p>I was so curious that I almost said yes, but then I remembered that the goal of that day was not to die so I kindly declined. </p>\n\n<p>”aw man, I wish I could. But I have to go to school early tomorrow.”</p>\n\n<p>”what school do you go to?” his mom questioned. Not even in a friendly way. More like an I better give her the answer she wanted to hear. </p>\n\n<p>”I go to Kennedy- it’s ten minutes away but it’s a good school.”</p>\n\n<p>“it must be fate”, she said with a smirk. “That’s the school William was enrolled in”</p>\n\n<p>“yeah man, that means we can just hang out at school tomorrow!”</p>\n</div>\n","author":"justanobodywholoves"}
