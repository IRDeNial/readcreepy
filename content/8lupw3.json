yeah. <em>that.</em> i jumped a bit, and the fucking deer head broke off its plaque, fell off the wall, and dented in its nose. the girl ran off, and i was gonna scream for her to come back, but my thoughts got cut off because a moth flew directly into my face.</p>\n\n<p>hundreds of fucking moths had been living in the deer head. the stuffing was completely hollowed out, replaced with moth eggs and moths which, thrown off by the disturbance, took the opportunity to swarm. my entire fucking kitchen was suddenly full of moths, which flittered around for a while, then died in the cold.</p>\n\n<p>i was kind of shaken by the whole ordeal, so i closed the door and went back to bed, figuring i&#39;d deal with the dead bugs in the morning. come the morning, termites had bit their way out of the wooden mount, and, come mid-day, they&#39;d frozen too. that night, spiders flooded my house to make dinner out of the corpses.</p>\n\n<p>i didn&#39;t see the girl again for a few weeks after that. she stopped consistently showing up every time i went hunting, and then she stopped consistently showing up on her walk, and then she stopped showing up at all. shitty as it is, i figured she&#39;d died, froze to death in the cold or something.</p>\n\n<p>but she didn&#39;t, as it turns out. i saw her once, a few months ago. she&#39;d cleaned up, and she was walking around with this skinny, social worker-looking white guy, who was prompting her to keep walking. i figured she&#39;d been brought into some sort of program, and i said &quot;hey, kid, where&#39;d you go?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>she turned to me, and social worker dude did too, and both of their eyes lit up.</p>\n\n<p>his eyes reflected like a deer, he paused in the wake of my porchlight, and if it hadn&#39;t been dark out, i would have been positive he had fucking antlers- tiny ones, but still. two dark shadows were on his forehead, equidistant from each other.</p>\n\n<p>he called back &quot;just visiting, sir,&quot; and gave me what looked like a smile. my porchlight flickered, and a moth floated into it and died.</p>\n\n<p>i don&#39;t get scared easily, but i got the shivers all the way down my spine, so i called back &quot;alright, good to know!&quot;, went inside, and locked the door.</p>\n\n<p>they went wherever the next day, and i&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;m never going to see her again. hope she&#39;s doing alright.</p>\n</div>\n","author":"cordyceqs"}
