My name is Jared and I&#39;m 16 years old. Just some background information, I&#39;m a short, geeky guy from Illinois who plays guitar and has a very select friend group. We basically do everything together, such as studying, going to movies, and playing music. My friends and I bought out an escape room as a celebration of finishing our AP Exams. The theme of it was a library, which we thought was appropriate since our party was school-related.</p>\n\n<p>It was called &quot;The Library of Secrets,&quot; which I&#39;m surprised wasn&#39;t taken down for copyright considering there&#39;s an awesome book with the same name. We went through the usual rules (I&#39;ve done a few) and we were told we would have exactly one hour to complete the room before we were &quot;sealed in forever,&quot; like the others who had tried to get the sacred book. Obviously I didn&#39;t think that it would actually happen. One curious thing he said that I thought might be interesting to note, the man said that &quot;You&#39;ll know when Things Fall Apart.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Rachel and I were in the middle of deciphering a code when suddenly there was a loud slam from somewhere and an alarm sound. It quickly turned off and I looked at the rest of my friends, who appeared to be as bewildered as I did. I took out my phone and checked the time. It had been exactly one hour. I knocked on the entrance door and tried to open it to no avail. We started calling for help but there was no response. </p>\n\n<p>Currently, we have 2 options. We can either try to solve the room, or force our way out. So far, neither have been successful. The door is a very thick metal (I&#39;m guessing titanium) and we only have two clues from the room, one of which is a piece of paper that says &quot;👌︎📁︎ ♏︎🗄︎ ♍︎🗐︎ ♐︎🗏︎✁︎ ♋︎📂︎&quot;. I have no idea what that means. The only other things of interest in here are random books and a piano. There&#39;s also two security cameras in here that seem to be recording, because they have a flashing red light. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re asking: &quot;Why don&#39;t you call the police?.&quot; That&#39;s a great idea, but the solid walls seem to restrict service in here. The only way I&#39;m able to type this is through their Wi-Fi, which has blocked everything except for reddit and a few games. No web browsers, no app store, nothing. I was lucky enough to have taken my backpack into the room with me (we came straight from school), so I had a charger. That seems to be the only thing positive about my situation. One more note, I hear some very quiet yelling from somewhere behind the books very occasionally. It could just be my mind playing tricks on me, but Colin and Chris hear it too.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just afraid that we&#39;ll really be trapped here, like that one guy said. I&#39;ll be sure to give you guys updates on the situation, and I await your input. Thanks.</p>\n</div>\n","author":"lkalman0526"}
