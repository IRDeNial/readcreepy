Not killing myself, just going off the grid. I want to tell everyone what I&#39;m doing and why I am doing it. So, let me explain.</p>\n\n<p>When I was 12 years old, there was a break in my family&#39;s home. My family was murdered by five men. Even my fucking two and brothers were shot, even though they were both under the age of seven. They didn&#39;t know I was there. When I heard the door break open, I hid under the bed. Hours later, after the men had left, I finally got out from under my bed to find what had been done to my family.</p>\n\n<p>For sixteen years, I have had rage building inside of me. I wanted to find out who killed my family and... well, you know... get some payback. </p>\n\n<p>On August 2nd, a man was arrested while he was assaulting his girlfriend with a crowbar. The police interrogated him and he was imprisoned. Turns out, he was one of the men who had killed my family. The police told the local news that the man had killed an &quot;entire family&quot; with four other men who he wouldn&#39;t name. He was a guy named Joseph Glenn, a man who I was friends with from college who I had gotten out of touch with. I had to compose myself before I knew what had to be done to him.</p>\n\n<p>I knew I had to get him out of jail. I just didn&#39;t know how. But, a thought came to my mind - what if I bail him out? I know it seems utterly retarded for me to bail this guy out, but I didn&#39;t care. I was getting revenge no matter what I had to do to get there.</p>\n\n<p>So, I went to the jail and bailed him out. He was thanking me on the way to my car, but I opened the passenger-side door, pulled out my pistol, and slammed the bottom of the grip of the pistol onto his head. He fell to the ground. He wasn&#39;t bleeding from his skull and he still had a pulse, so I knew he was alive. </p>\n\n<p>I dragged him into the backseat of my car and slumped him over. I drove him to the desert, where he would only be found if they dug him up. I pulled him out of the backseat, and slammed his head into the car door, waking him up. He jumped and yelled, &quot;What the fuck?!&quot;. I simply replied, &quot;Where are they?&quot;. He began stuttering, saying he doesn&#39;t know where &quot;they&quot; are or who &quot;they&quot; are.</p>\n\n<p>I told him the men who killed an entire family. He said he knew information about one. This person, who he called &quot;Windbreaker&quot; for how he can shoot really powerful guns, was currently in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was a divorced, unemployed alcoholic. I asked him what his real name was, and he said, &quot;Adam Thomas,&quot;. I said, &quot;Thank you, Joseph,&quot; before throwing him to the ground and shooting him in the head. I buried his body where he was shot.</p>\n\n<p>So, now it was time to go after Adam. I had to find out where this guy lived somehow, and I luckily found out soon enough. So, I drove four hours to Las Vegas, knowing where he lived. I found where he was living. It was some really run down house that looked fucking disgusting from the outside.</p>\n\n<p>I jimmied open a window from the outside and opened it quietly. I walked into the house, and it reeked of liquor. I could tell what it was, too - Jack Daniels. I quietly tip-toed around the house, looking in every room, until I found Adams room. </p>\n\n<p>He was sitting at a desk, unconscious, swimming in his own vomit. To be honest, if he could handle really big weapons, he surely didn&#39;t look like he could. He looked.. weak. I slammed his head into the desk, waking him up. He was shocked and looked at me. He was so utterly terrified, I could see it in his eyes. I almost felt bad for the guy.</p>\n\n<p>But, I had to continue asking questions. I put the barrel of my gun under his chin, and he looked at me, terrified. I asked him where the rest were and told him that I had killed Glenn already. He was shocked and said, &quot;I only know where Max Fischer is, okay?&quot;. He told me where he lived, how he travels a lot, and that he&#39;s even armed and to be prepared in case he starts shooting back at me.</p>\n\n<p>So, I pulled the trigger. Adam&#39;s brain splattered all over the wall. Now, time for Max.</p>\n\n<p>Max lived in a farmhouse in the middle of Texas. So, it was obvious that he was gonna be armed. I deiced to park my car about 300 feet behind me, just so that he doesn&#39;t know where I would be going.</p>\n\n<p>I walked up to his farmhouse and stopped when I saw a person sitting on the porch. I knew it was him. He got up, grabbed a shotgun from the table, and walked towards me. He cocked the gun halfway through walking towards me. &quot;Who the hell are you and what the fuck do you want?&quot; he asked in his thick southern accent. &quot;Are you Max?&quot; I replied. &quot;Yeah, who&#39;s asking?&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>I pulled out my pistol quicker than I ever have before in my life. I shot him, and the bullet went into his stomach. He fell to the ground, wheezing. I kicked him over, and yelled, &quot;Where are the rest?&quot;. He looked utterly confused. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who the fuck are you talking about?&quot;. &quot;You know who I&#39;m talking about, Max. The five men who killed an entire family sixteen years ago, where are they?!&quot;. &quot;Wh.. Who... the f-fuck are y-you?&quot; he asked, stuttering. &quot;Tell me where the rest are and you will live.&quot;. &quot;The rest?&quot;. I explained to him that I had already killed Glenn and Thomas, and he freaked out. &quot;Okay, I kn- I know where the last two are, but you must let me live. I have a wife and two kids, please!&quot;. That&#39;s when it hit me hard.</p>\n\n<p>These men, who I had been killing, have most likely had kids. These men, who I had been killing to get revenge for my family also had families. They had loved ones. Friends. Children. He told me the information, and I said, &quot;Go spend time with your children and your wife. Make it last. My memories of my family died years ago. Don&#39;t let that happen to you&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I walked back to my car and began to cry as I started up the car. I realized that what I had been doing was for my own selfish need for vengeance, for revenge just so that I felt like justice had been &quot;served&quot; to the men who killed my family. I decided to stay in a hotel in Texas for a few days, where I was able to think about if I should kill the men who killed my family.</p>\n\n<p>On the second day, I remembered back to that night. Max had said, &quot;Why the fuck are we killing them? You just said we would take their shit and leave!&quot;, to which one of two men, who weren&#39;t Thomas or Glenn, said, &quot;We have unfinished business with the bastard. Get in our way, and we&#39;ll shoot you, like how we shot his dumbass wife.&quot;. Then, a second man said, &quot;We&#39;re gonna kill the kids too. No witnesses.&quot;. I stopped lamenting and packed my things. I went out and bought an AR-15 assault rifle and a hunting rifle. I was gonna kill the last two sick fuckers.</p>\n\n<p>I drove to where both of the men were and parked nearly a mile away. I found a place where I could shoot the fucker from high up and finish them off from the ground. They were in a warehouse, with two guards at each of their sides, all four guards carrying submachine guns. When I saw those guards, I was fucking petrified. I knew that I could easily get a bullet through my head today if I wasn&#39;t careful enough. So, I aimed the shot at one of the guards on the left. I made sure to aim for his head. </p>\n\n<p>Boom. The guard was hit in the chest and he fell almost instantly. I aimed at the other guard, who was just standing around like a fucking idiot. Boom. Again, a bullet hit him in the chest. Shit, the guards were rushing the guys out the back door. I ran down from where I was and pulled out AR. I was following behind them, firing at them. I shot on the guards several times. I shot at the other guard, and he was shot multiple times as well. The only two left were the killers. I pulled out the hunting rifle when I noticed a truck in the distance. Shit, they were gonna try and escape. I fired right past them. Back left tire down. Front left tire down. Then, I went in for the prize. I shot one of the men in the leg, knocking him down. Then, I shot the other in the leg. </p>\n\n<p>Both of them were on the ground, begging for mercy. I pulled out my pistol and shot one of them in the head, while I picked up the other one. &quot;This is for my family, you piece of shit.&quot;. I pulled out my switchblade and jammed the blade into his throat. He started choking on his own blood. I walked back to my car, and him there to die.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;m going off the grid. There have been parties searching for me since my DNA was found at the crime scenes. I might be back. I just don&#39;t know if I will.</p>\n</div>\n","author":"sillywilly04"}
