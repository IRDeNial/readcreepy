James told me that they were there, but I didn&#39;t really care. And still. Each and every day, James would say, &#39;Down the path, to the right, past the pricker bushes and <em>all</em> the way down.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>There were giants. </p>\n\n<p>He would whisper it from his bed. He was real good at that. James that was the type of kid that could tell a bedtime story so terrible, so shocking, that it made all the little hairs on your neck and arm prickle up like crazy. </p>\n\n<p>I am not so good like that, but I will try.</p>\n\n<p><em>They were three mean giants, and each was dirtier and nastier and than the last one.</em></p>\n\n<p>The biggest one was the lady giant. </p>\n\n<p>James called her Big Red, because her hair was bright red like my bed-sheets. She had a real crackly voice he used to do, and it sounded like our old neighbor after she smoked her whole pack of cigarettes.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Get over here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kind of like that.</p>\n\n<p>One time, James was so loud when he was doing Big Red&#39;s voice that mom came in our room and turned the light on because we were playing past bedtime. We laughed about that for a little while before she had to check on his medicine again.</p>\n\n<p>Big Red never wore any clothes. But James said that was because there weren&#39;t any clothes could fit her huge, gnarly belly. Her skin was saggy and old like ice cream, and she smelled so bad that you would know she was coming from a mile away. Like old cabbage and burned french fries. When she talked, two lonely yellow teeth poked out of her mashing gums and pinched together. </p>\n\n<p>She was also about a gazillion feet tall.</p>\n\n<p>The next biggest giant was a man giant, and he could not wear any clothes either. The other ones called him Rippo, and he was a <em>trillion</em> feet tall. Rippo was the meanest, because once he got a hold of a boy he would hit and hit and hit him until the boy just had to fall asleep for a while. He had all of his yellow teeth left, and they were sharp like knives that could pierce the skin in a second. James showed me the marks.</p>\n\n<p>The last giant was maybe only a million feet tall, and the clothes he wore were real dirty and gray and ripped all the over the place. James called him Muscrat, on account of the fact his voice was always squeaky like a mouse. But Muscrat looked more like a cat. He was great at slinking and sliding between the trees, making himself unseen. He reminded me a lot of our housecat, Mellow, because Muscrat also had terribly long nails, and every time he touched your skin a thin red mark would follow each fingernail&#39;s path.</p>\n\n<p>James showed me those marks, too.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t believe him. Not really. One day when James was at the Doctor&#39;s, she took me to the local library and I found the biggest book on giants in the whole place. I asked mom to help me read the big words when she wasn&#39;t sad, but I got most of the idea from the pictures.</p>\n\n<p>There was never any real giants. They were make-believe, stupid stuff for kids and babies that lived only in stories and fairytales. The next day at school, I brought in my giant book to class and told them all about the things I had learned in my big books. When the teacher saw it, she told me to read a more adult book, everyone laughed at me.</p>\n\n<p>After a while, I got tired of James&#39; stories.</p>\n\n<p>Each day was a new chapter that included where the giants lived, what they ate, how many children they killed. I remember one night when he talked about how the giants used the bones of kids they ate as tools and decorations all around their wood cabin. It was so scary and so detailed but I kept the comfort of knowing it was never real.</p>\n\n<p>It was all so silly that it soon just seemed stupid. How can you be scared of something you know is fake? Two library books had already told me the truth, and even my mom had caved and told me there was no such thing as giants. </p>\n\n<p>I told James he was a baby and I didn&#39;t want to hear his dumb baby stories anymore. Not long after that, he got even more sick.</p>\n\n<p>Mom promised it was not because of of our fight, but I did not believe her either. The doctors said the holes in his head were not healing right. That the hospital we had in our house was no good and he needed to go to the city full-time. We stayed with him each and every day and night, but the news was bad.</p>\n\n<p>One day, mom told me James wouldn&#39;t be able to talk anymore. </p>\n\n<p>The next day, James could not smell. I thought it might be good to finally be rid of the stench of old cabbage.</p>\n\n<p>But after that, James did not know we were in the room at all. </p>\n\n<p>On that last night, I cried in the hospital room and begged James to wake up and tell me one last story about the giants. He was so quiet and so still, with only his chest moving up and down that it seemed like he could still be awakened. Like the doctors were idiots and he was fine all along. I just wanted to see his green eyes light up one last time. To warn me, to scare me, whatever it was I begged for it again and again.</p>\n\n<p>But he didn&#39;t answer. The monitor beeped and beeped and beeped but James never answered.</p>\n\n<p>Mom took me home after that and left me at the house. She had to take care of a few things, and she made me promise her to be good. She locked all the doors, put on all the cameras and told me she would be home soon. But I was a crafty kid. Twenty minutes after mom was gone, I was out the back door and into the woods.</p>\n\n<p>Down the path, off to the right, past the pricker bushes and <em>all</em> the way down. </p>\n\n<p>I needed to see it for myself. Something about his story told me that those giants were still there all along. Even as a kid, I knew that my whole life would be wondering about the monsters my big brother talked about every night before he died.</p>\n\n<p>It was dark and terrifying that night, but I tried not to cry. There were owls hooting above my head and the air was clear. It had rained that day, and water dripped from the leaves onto my head and light grey jacket.</p>\n\n<p>James had never told anybody else where the giants were, or much about them at all. He said they would eat him if he ever did. But James trusted me with the story, and James was not here anymore. It was up to me to find the truth.</p>\n\n<p>There were no other noises but the campfire. I heard it after about a mile, but it wasn&#39;t hiding. It was in the middle of a clearing, not far from the highway.</p>\n\n<p>There were three gathered around it, James had been right about that. The woman had bright red hair and was cackling at the others in that same craggy voice. Another was massive, with a burly chest covered in hair that dipped to his shoulders. The third was passive, hiding behind a tree just out of the light of the fire. They stood in front of an old cabin connected to a side street I had never seen before.</p>\n\n<p>I did not stay to find out more. James told me that if you took your shoes off and ran on the pine needles, the giants couldn&#39;t hear you, so that was my best chance to not get eaten. The needles and leaves cut my feet like tiny knives, but without shoes I was quieter than the forest itself. In minutes, I was home in the arms of my mother. </p>\n\n<p>I told her everything in a sobbing mess. About James&#39; stories before bed. About the giants. About what I saw. She panicked and phoned the police immediately. It wasn&#39;t long before our driveway was packed with police cars and we were answering all kinds of questions. None of it made much sense to me at the time. But one thing a nice officer said still sticks with me.</p>\n\n<p>Kids see only what they are able to see. </p>\n\n<p>To me, those three did not look like giants.</p>\n</div>\n","author":"iWontBeFound"}
