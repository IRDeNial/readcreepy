I got out of my car and went for a walk.  How could children draw a story so grim?  Public shootings are common, the world is quite dim.  We need to ban guns or take them off market.  The only wisdom ever spoken from the red carpet.</p>\n\n<p>I read on and on.  The story did prolong.  I got to a part where something felt wrong:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I follow the children</p>\n\n<p>I follow the car</p>\n\n<p>I felt a chill when</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t get far</p>\n\n<p>I bumped my head</p>\n\n<p>On a TV screen</p>\n\n<p>This entire time led</p>\n\n<p>To a police station scene</p>\n\n<p>I was watching on tape</p>\n\n<p>The events all unfold</p>\n\n<p>My mouth was agape</p>\n\n<p>Since the story it told</p>\n\n<p>Was about a man in a car</p>\n\n<p>Who shot kids for fun</p>\n\n<p>That man, whose the star</p>\n\n<p>Was I the same one?</p>\n\n<p>Asked questions all day</p>\n\n<p>They told me the facts</p>\n\n<p>They said I will stay</p>\n\n<p>Until I payed for my acts</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was at this point in the story.  Where I have had all the glory.  This poem was about me.  I chuckled and giggled with glee.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The court found me guilty</p>\n\n<p>The court made me serve</p>\n\n<p>Now my heart feels all silky</p>\n\n<p>Its what I deserve</p>\n\n<p>I sit down unseen</p>\n\n<p>They pull out a syringe</p>\n\n<p>A lethal vaccine </p>\n\n<p>And I start to cringe</p>\n\n<p>My life feels so hollow</p>\n\n<p>It all ends this way</p>\n\n<p>The children I&#39;ll follow</p>\n\n<p>With children I&#39;ll stay</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I finish the poem.  I feel like I know him.  I sit still and wait.  For the pain it creates.  As soon as it does, I feel it.  The needle went in, they seal it. </p>\n\n<p>I woke up with fear.  The dream felt so near.  I turn on my phone and see.  To see if my dream lied to me.  </p>\n\n<p>I see a story on Google news.  It has over 10 million views.  A car drove by my childhood street.  I asked around people I never did meet. </p>\n\n<p>When they saw who I was they panicked and yelled.  I would not believe the story they telled.  I was a set of twin brothers.  It was a secret of my mother&#39;s.  I felt a connection in his last hour.  It was due to what you&#39;d call twin power.  </p>\n\n<p>I went home after the press.  Asked me questions I digress.  All about my unknown twin.  And the violence that took place within.</p>\n\n<p>I lay in my bed as thoughts start to chase.  I look to my right and see my gun case.  I know he brought me shame.  But perhaps we are the same.  </p>\n\n<p>I look out the window pane.  I see kids playing some silly game.  I go outside.  I walk with a glide.  There is something I hold.  It is metal and cold.</p>\n\n<p>And I do what I was told.</p>\n\n<p>I follow the children.</p>\n</div>\n","author":"Kaladad9893"}
