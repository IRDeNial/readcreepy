One evening I had this strong feeling  of being watched, I tried to shake it off but couldn’t, I tried not to let anyone realise I was feeling uneasy, At around 11pm, I decided it was getting late and headed upstairs, the feeling still with me, becoming stronger every second,As I was walking down the corridor to my room, I heard some weird noises coming from one of the bathrooms (one that no one ever uses), something I can’t describe, it was like a muffled voice but not quite. </p>\n\n<p>I stood frozen for a couple of seconds but I tried to convince myself it was a cousin trying to scare me or something although last time I checked everyone was downstairs, I slowly opened the door, almost 100% sure, I will find my cousin there,but as I opened the door and went in everything went quiet, the sounds were gone, no one was there,at that point I was scared to death,I decided to run downstairs, almost crying, I told my oldest cousin everything but she told me I was just imagining things although it was clear she herself was quite alarmed, she came upstairs with me, took me to my room (there were no more noises), she probably stayed there until I fell asleep,</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly I wake up in the middle of the night with the same feeling of being watched way way stronger, as I look towards my closet there’s this really tall male shiloutte  completely dark, darker than pitch black,I scream in horror, it moves closer and closer towards me without moving it gives me  this really unsettling smile, (something like straight out of a horror movie which would scare the living crap out of an adult let alone a 10 year old)  before it disappears,  suddenly everyone runs into my room, my mom turns on the light and nothings there, I tell them everything, literally I was on the verge of a mental breakdown, they all seem to believe me for some reason, which is very odd, even my grandad who is usually rude and critical seems to believe me and tries to calm me down, </p>\n\n<p>Quite soon after that my life hit rock bottom my best friend died and it didn’t go so good between my parents ,from that time on, wherever I go, even back home I still have the same feeling of being watched (even though it’s been quite a bit of time), sometimes weaker sometimes stronger, I’ve never seen it again and pray not to, although sometimes I do see the same  shiloutte but faintly, in another room but it never seems to see me...</p>\n\n<p>Did anyone have a similar experience ?</p>\n</div>\n","author":"Janahannahbanana"}
