We had recently purchased and moved into our first house. I guess you could say we were &quot;living the American dream.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>At first everything was fairly ordinary around the new house. It wasn&#39;t too long before we got quite the surprise: my wife was pregnant! With the excitement of our first child on the way, our lives grew more distracted from our dogs.</p>\n\n<p>you know how when dogs sleep they often times will wake up barking, or run off to a corner of the house and start barking at an empty room? well our dogs did this almost as soon as we brought them home.</p>\n\n<p>it wasnt very often but they would still wake up in this way in the middle of the night on occasion. we just ignored it most of the time and chalked it up to dogs being dogs. we even got to the point that we wouldnt even notice them when they did it.</p>\n\n<p>they started doing it more often. we just thought they were having more frequent puppy dreams from the chaos of the new baby but it has seemed a little different than it was in the beginning. </p>\n\n<p>it started about a few months ago, our daughter had just turned 6 months old, when one dog woke up at 3am running downstairs to bark incesently at a dark corner of our living room. that first time i went downstairs as my husband duties would state to check it out.</p>\n\n<p>all doors locked</p>\n\n<p>nothing out of the ordinary in the living room,</p>\n\n<p>i told the dogs to shut up and come back to bed. this happend 3 more times that week each time again at 3am with nothing ever being out of place when i checked each time.  at that point i just assumed my dogs were being assholes. </p>\n\n<p>they didnt wake up for a couple nights after that so i figured they were over their little game. </p>\n\n<p>the next week however they started right back up again. And again at 3am and each time still with nothing wrong about our living room.</p>\n\n<p>after  the 3rd time that second week it wasnt &quot;checking on something being wrong&quot; it was &quot;going to get the dogs from downstairs&quot; and shutting them up before they woke the baby. this being the case my wife and i started taking turns going to get them.</p>\n\n<p>by the 3rd week they were doing it every single night. one night it was my wifes turn to go get them and as she gets downstairs to them i hear her scream so i get up and rush downstairs to see what has happend.</p>\n\n<p>what hit me first was the smell, like a punch to the face i could smell pure death and decay, like a body had been rotting in the sun for weeks on the floor of an abandond farm house.  </p>\n\n<p>in the middle of the floor was a dead black bird. how could just a bird create such a foul smell. as i looked closer at the morbid scene in my living room i saw that the insides of the bird were spread around its body in neatly made piles. There were maggots swarming inside the gaping hole the decayed bird had in place of its chest.</p>\n\n<p>it was in a state of decay as if it had been there for weeks which was impossible. We were there mearly hours ago watching tv before bed. </p>\n\n<p>i cleaned it up as best i could, as my wife round up the dogs and went back to sleep.</p>\n\n<p>the next morning i went downstairs to see how bad the stain was and if we would need to replace the carpet to get rid of the smell and it was all gone. it was as if nothing was ever there. </p>\n\n<p>no stain</p>\n\n<p>no smell</p>\n\n<p>nothing</p>\n\n<p>even the bag i had thrown it away in and taken outside to the garbage was gone. it was all as if it never happend. i asked my wife if i had dreamed it but she remembered all of it just as clearly as i did. She remembered all the vivid details like i did. as confused as we were about the whole thing we just shrugged it off and were happy to not have to replace the carpet.</p>\n\n<p>that next night, like clockwork, at 3am the dogs shot up and ran off barking to the living room. this time both my wife and i decided to get up together to get the dogs just in case something strange happend again we both wanted to see it.</p>\n\n<p>as we walked down the steps my wife walking ahead of me. the both of us tredgeing through the house half awake from the sleep we had been losing from this whole ordeal, and growing more and more angry at this continuous disturbance every night.</p>\n\n<p>My wife lead the way as we walked down the steps toward the living room where the dogs always ran.</p>\n\n<p>as we neared the living room i noticed the dogs had stopped barking and were standing side by side, hair raised, growling at the dark corner of the room. </p>\n\n<p>as my wife rounds the corner she lets out a quick scream and jumps back behind me. i take the lead walking around the corner to see what she sees, a dark shadowy figure standing in the corner. its there just long enough to notice it before it vanishes from sight, fading into the blackness of the night. </p>\n\n<p>Just a flicker, a blink and it was gone. as soon as it evaporated the dogs stop growling and they turn around and walk back upstairs as if nothing happened. </p>\n\n<p>still standing stareing at the corner not quite comprehending what we had just seen, my wife turns the light on just to double check. as the flick of the switch illuminates the room, the space in which the figure was standing sits a bookshelf, same as its always been. we look at each other blankly.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;you saw that too right?&quot; my wife says to me</p>\n\n<p>&quot;yeah i think so, but theres clearly nothing there now, lets just go back to bed, not much we can do about an empty room in the middle of the night.&quot; i replied</p>\n\n<p>we go back upstairs and struggle to fall back to sleep, both still feeling uneasy from the experience. soon enough we both did drift off and didnt wake till the following morning to the usual alarm.</p>\n\n<p>a week went by without the dogs performing their new found nightly ritual of waking at 3am. tearing through the house barking at some unseen entity in the living room. we felt as though it was over and we would have no more nights woken by the crazed barking ritual. </p>\n\n<p>but that very night it started again and thats when it really started getting out of hand.</p>\n\n<p>3am once again</p>\n\n<p>the time of night i began to dread</p>\n\n<p>It had been happening so often that i began having trouble sleeping, because my body had started preparing for it. waking me up at 2:30 every night anxious just waiting for it to happen, and like i had recently gotten use to, i was awake unable to fall back to sleep, and as the clock switched from 2:59 to 3 the dogs shot up. </p>\n\n<p>first bodhi then mae,  instantly barking and taking off toward the stairway. i got up to follow, whisper shouting at them to be quiet.</p>\n\n<p>that night as i rounded the corner to the living room i could hear an odd buzzing sound, almost electric, like some sort of contraption devized by tesla hummed in the room adjacent. </p>\n\n<p>As i entered the living room it seemed as usual, nothing but a dark room, no shadow, no dead bird, nothing but the droning hum.</p>\n\n<p>the buzzing was louder in this room than it was coming down the steps. The sound was clearly coming from this room. </p>\n\n<p>I noticed the walls looked odd as well, other than the sound. not sure if it was that my eyes hadnt adjusted to the darkness fully yet or what the case may be but the walls definately seemed darker. </p>\n\n<p>i flipped on the light and instantly the walls erupted with millions of flies. swarming over the walls and with thesudden addition of the light they took flight and bursted into a black anamorphic cloud, swirling around the room, the sound went from a buzz to a malific roar. </p>\n\n<p>Then seconds later they each exploded, each one of the millions of flies took turns blowing apart as if each one were a tiny fire cracker.</p>\n\n<p>And then</p>\n\n<p>nothing</p>\n\n<p>almost within a blink they were all gone. not somewhere else in the house but gone, completely, vanished, back to the normal living room again.</p>\n\n<p>i had no words to explain, i mean i wasnt even sure how to say what had just happend, just then the dogs came from around the corner, apparently they had hid when the flies began to swarm. </p>\n\n<p>shake it off</p>\n\n<p>no explination</p>\n\n<p>so dont worry about it</p>\n\n<p>didnt really happen</p>\n\n<p>just a product of lack of sleep</p>\n\n<p>back to bed</p>\n\n<p>For acting so tough it was pathetic to see the dogs cower at the sight of bugs. Then again, we raised them to be our family not gard dogs.</p>\n\n<p>the next night, again i was prepared, already awake, almost started walking downstairs before it even hit 3, but for some reason i waited till the dogs ran off. </p>\n\n<p>as i got down the steps the putrid smell of the first night this had started was back. wretched decay flooding my nostrils, nearly making me vomit. The smell so vile it burned my eyes. </p>\n\n<p>as i stepped off the final step my foot hit the floor with a crunch.</p>\n\n<p>this was new.</p>\n\n<p>every following step also crunched, the floor sounded like i was stepping over large bugs when it should have been nothing more than soft carpet. the feel of it didnt match the sound it made either, </p>\n\n<p>slippery, </p>\n\n<p>slimy, </p>\n\n<p>wet. </p>\n\n<p>something oozed between my toes as i walked. the smell still so pungent i could barely breathe. i finally got to the living room to where i could reach the light switch. the dogs alternating between whimpering and growling at this point, seeming to be just as confused as i was. i got the light switch flipped on and my jaw dropped. </p>\n\n<p>covering the floor, walls, every conceivable surface was flesh, some rotten some fresh, but just pieces of flesh. Hands, chunks of arms and legs, it looked like hundreds of bodies had been thrown in a wood chipper and sprayed all over my house.</p>\n\n<p>laying on the couch was a body, impossibly decayed and barely recognizeable as human. crawling with a deep dark unknown pestillence. the blood and infectious rot gave off a smell so thick you could actually see it in the air. Tiny particals visably floating through the air like bubbles of infectious spores.</p>\n\n<p>i called up to my wife. wanting someone besides me to confirm what i was seeing. i could hear her footsteps in the ceiling as she made her way toward the steps and heard her speak as she got halfway down the steps.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;what the fuck is that smell?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>she got to the bottom of the steps and refused to go any further as she had seen what was covering the floor not wanting to step on it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;is that what i think it is? do you see this?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;yeah thats why i called you down here i wanted to make sure i wasnt halucenating&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;get the dogs, wash up as you come upstairs, if its like the bird it will be gone in the morning&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;youre right ill be up in a sec&quot;</p>\n\n<p>id like to say at this point we had gotten rather used to creepy things happening, that and the addition of us watching nothing but scary movies all the time we tend to brush stuff off rather easily like that</p>\n\n<p>sure enough in the morning the house was back to normal, like it always was. </p>\n\n<p>im not sure why but the nights got more and more intense after that, more gruesome, worse smelling, it was almost like whatever it was kept trying harder and harder to scare us or something. </p>\n\n<p>we started just walking down flipping the lights on grabbing the dogs, flipping the lights back off and heading back upstairs, barely acknowledging whatever creepy thing had been in that room.</p>\n\n<p>this must have made whatever was doing it mad, because things stopped going back to normal in the morning. not completely anyway.</p>\n\n<p>it was almost like it started over only stronger, it started back with a bird again. like before only it wasnt just one destroyed bird but 3. gutted and blood spread out all over the floor. this time however when i woke up the blood and entrails were gone, but the birds were not. they were still lying on the floor.</p>\n\n<p>it became apparent that i couldnt ignore it anymore. i picked the birds up with a trash bag and threw them away, steam cleaned the carpet where they were lying to kind of sterilize the floor.</p>\n\n<p>i still had no idea how the birds could have gotten in the house and no way could they have been there long enough to have decayed as much as they were. </p>\n\n<p>next night i walked down the dogs wouldnt even leave the steps, not even growling, they looked scared and were silent. i made it to the bottom step and as the smell hit me so did the whisper.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;dont ignore me&quot;</p>\n\n<p>barely audible but there</p>\n\n<p>the dogs whimpered, warning and begging me to go no further. They knew that nothing good lie beyond that threshold. as i made the final step, passing the still unassuming doorway, i ignored their warning and walked into the living room.</p>\n\n<p>it was like walking through a gateway into hell this time, as soon as i walked through the door the house faded away. i was surrounded by blood and black rotting pus, it wasnt my house anymore, that last step had placed me far away into another realm. One like i had never seen before, it was a terrifying mix of pain and unbridled horror.</p>\n\n<p>i heard screams of anguish somewhere off in the distance. As i stood there in utter shock i noticed i was standing in a long hall. The walls were bleeding, it was very dimly lit, i could only see 5 maybe 10 feet ahead of me, and screams seemed to be coming from every door.</p>\n\n<p>i opened the first door i came to, and instantlly i regret it. inside was a woman, spread out and tied to some type of vertical table. her screams pierced my psyche. there was another figure in there grotesque in every way possible. there were razor blades and nails sticking out of his flesh. his skin dripped with a black oily substance. </p>\n\n<p>his back was turned to me as he looked over a rusted steel table covered with horrendously arcaic and rudementary surgical tools. i realized what the screams were from as i saw him grab a rusted knife and begin to cut and peal away the womans skin from her body.</p>\n\n<p>i imediately slammed the door shut and turned back down the hall from the direction i came. i saw no sign of how i had arrived in this place and couldnt imagine how to get back out. the hallway behind me appeared to go on forever and i couldnt understand it because i hadnt ventured that far down the hall before that first door.</p>\n\n<p>as i walked back each side of the hall was lined with doors each one bearing its own individual scream of pain and terror adding to the over all cacophony of agony eminating the air around me. it was so loud it hurt my ears but there was no escaping it. </p>\n\n<p>i opened another door hoping it would be the one to return me to my reality but as i opened this one i heard the iconic laugh of a clown. the door swung open and what i saw was the head and torso of a clown, strapped to some sort of satanic contraption. </p>\n\n<p>a big red fake nose, rainbow colored hair wet and matted with blood, laughing insanely as he sodomized what looked like some type of sadistic genetic experiment gone wrong. </p>\n\n<p>it looked like a failed cross breed between a pig and a human, something directly out of The Island of Dr. Mareu. it was strapped with razor wire face down on what looked like a rusted steel saw horse. squeeling and screaming at the same time as it dripped blood. the clown torso in its contraption swang back and forth penetrating the creature as he yelled his crazy clown laughter.</p>\n\n<p>again i slammed the door searching for the one that would release me back into my own house. i burst into 3 more doors each one with more insane and more grotesque scenes being played out in each one. each time catching a glimpse of something i would never be able to un-see, things that would be burned into my mind forever, tearing out a little of my soul each time.</p>\n\n<p>the third door i opened contained a blob of a man standing alone facing the door. as i opened it he stared in my direction. he was immense in weight and size. his eyes pure black ink and his mouth was missing. it was nothing but fat appearing to have skin just grown over where it should be. </p>\n\n<p>he groaned in pain as he stood there with giant hooks stabbed through his flesh, attached to chains anchored to the walls. they were each holding up different chunks of fat exposing his naked sweat and blood covered body. he was covered in scars and pus oozing sores. </p>\n\n<p>he stood forever stroking himself until i burst into the room. the sight of another figure apparently all he needed to shoot blood and black tar all over the floor. as it hit the floor glass shards rained down on him from above creating more cuts and wounds in his flesh and he reset after screaming his muffled mouthless scream.</p>\n\n<p>the horrific image burned into my mind as i turned and slammed that door in search of the way out. another door, hopefully this is the one.</p>\n\n<p>the fourth door i opened in that hellish nightmare seemed a little less disturbing as i walked in. the room was red, all red, walls, floor, ceiling. there was a black leather couch centered in the room. at first i didnt see anything else in the room and was appreciative of this unexpected break from insanity.</p>\n\n<p>a moment to catch my breath i thought, but just then a child emerged from behind the couch. or at least i thought it was a child at first. </p>\n\n<p>it began to crawl over to me and once it was fully in view i realized it was merely the head of a child attached to a body. the mouth way to large as it smiled sharp jaged shark-like teeth its lips litterally stretched from ear to ear. the arms and legs had been animalistically ripped from its body and replaced with some form of rusted steel make-shift robotics. </p>\n\n<p>it moved awkwardly accross the floor a few feet before releasing an inhuman roar mixed with a childs scream. the sight caused me to vomit as 2 more nearly identical creatures emerged from the floor behind the couch. they screamed at eachother and began violently tearing eachother apart.</p>\n\n<p>as i fell back scrambling to get out of that room before they turned to me for their next meal i slammed the door behind me, and i thought i might never find my way back, i could be lost in this hellish hallway forever. it had already been so long since i stepped over the threshold of the steps and into this place. </p>\n\n<p>the fifth door i opened in the hallway i dont even know how to describe. i stepped in walking right into strands of flesh stretched to and from various points in the room. it was a spiderweb mess of blood soaked entrails and venomly pungent smells. i heard the first and only words in that room. it started as a low rumble but escalated to vibrate everything including the air in my lungs as it spoke. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;you cannot ignore me&quot;</p>\n\n<p>those four words rang out through the torrent of screams as it stepped into view. a giant spider like creature composed of torn body parts, both human and animal. crudely placed and held together with blood and rotting disease. </p>\n\n<p>mismatched legs tipped with still screaming heads or skulls propelled it toward me. its torso more human than the rest of it seemed to be all one piece yet it was inhumanly large, its head was alien in shape, probably because it appeared to be multiple skulls from different animals mashed together. what looked like deer antlers covered in flesh made up mandables, hung below the oversized gaping hole i assumed was its mouth.</p>\n\n<p>the different animal heads mashed together giving the creature 4 eyes all piercing and so black i could feel it pulling out part of my soul as it stared into me. it stopped before reaching me and leaned itself down toward me. the smell of the rotting flesh used to create such an entity was so foul i had to fight to make myself breathe. as it leaned closer the air around me began to rumble again as it did when it first spoke. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;i am always watching&quot;</p>\n\n<p>the vibrations of its words shook me to my knees. it was so loud i felt as though my ear drums would burst.</p>\n\n<p>the creature turned from me  and walked back into its web of flesh, and i got to my feet and ran back out through the door. as i stepped through the air shook.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;always....watching&quot;</p>\n\n<p>the creatures final two words as i slammed the door behind me echoed in my head. as i stood there on the other side of that door i noticed the the hallway had ended and there was a familiar door at the end just a short distance down the hall. i ran for it, hoping that it would lead me back home and out of this nightmare. </p>\n\n<p>i finally found the door and ran through it screaming and tripping up the steps, falling into the wimpering dogs who were waiting there for my return. i was out, i was back in my house, back in my stairway. </p>\n\n<p>my wife came running to the stairway pleading me to tell her what happend, but i had no words. i couldnt bring myself to describe to her what i had seen, or where i had been for what seemed like hours when it apparently was mere minutes. </p>\n\n<p>the dogs had stopped before the bottom of the steps that night, warning me to go no further and i ignored their warning. we moved from that house shortly after. in fact we moved to a completely different state. </p>\n\n<p>ill never be able to forget what happend that night, but i like our new house, its cozy and quiet. weve been here for almost a year now with no problems.</p>\n\n<p>but last night the dogs woke up barking at 3am</p>\n\n<p>this time when the dogs stop scared before going through a door, i listen</p>\n\n<p>...listen to the dogs...</p>\n</div>\n","author":"cryptic_nightmares"}
